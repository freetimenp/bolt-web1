    title: "Optimizing React Performance in Large-Scale Applications",
    journal: "Journal of Web Engineering",
    date: "June 2023",
    abstract: "This paper presents novel techniques for optimizing the performance of React applications with large component trees and complex state management requirements. We introduce a hybrid approach combining selective rendering, virtualization, and state locality that resulted in a 60% reduction in render time across multiple benchmarks.",

    title: "Machine Learning Approaches for Automated Code Review and Quality Analysis",
    journal: "IEEE Software",
    date: "October 2022",
    abstract: "We present a novel machine learning system for automated code review that goes beyond basic linting and style checking. The system analyzes code patterns, identifies potential bugs and security vulnerabilities, and suggests architectural improvements based on learned patterns from high-quality codebases.",
